            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>The goal is to show your knowledge and economic sense by ending up by the best selection of items by the end of the game.</p>
            <p>This tool is supposed to help you make fun challanges with friends. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Draft the best deck using Trading Cards</li>
                <li>Draft the best hero/champion team for League of Legends / Dota 2</li>
                <li>Build the best tools to build something awesome</li>
                <li>Draft the best color combination to make art with</li>
                <li>Your fantasy is the limit!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Note!: this tool will not provide the game itself after the draft, purely the selection of restrictions.</b></p>
